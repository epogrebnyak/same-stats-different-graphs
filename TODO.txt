Ideas for refactoring
=====================

Really neded:

- unit tests (started)
- Github actions for remote tests

Possible bugs:

- generated image subplots are is misaligned

Suggested - package structure:

- separate datasets, data processing, visualisation and CLI into own modules:
  - datasets
  - visual.py
  - cli.py
  - transform.py

Suggested - other:

- redirect csv and png output to output directory (always writes to root now) 
- run black and isort over code
- unused keyword arguments in some fucntions

```
run_pattern(df,
                target,
                iters=100000,
                num_frames=100,
                decimals=2,
                shake=0.2, # NOT USED
                max_temp=0.4,
                min_temp=0,
                ramp_in=False,
                ramp_out=False,
                freeze_for=0,
                reset_counts=False, # NOT USED
                custom_points=False): # NOT USED
```

Questions:

- why no space between args at samestats run <shape_start> <shape_end> [<iters>][<decimals>][<frames>]
- why __main__.py is needed?
- why save generated dataset in package, can save in repo folder

May use:

- poetry for packaging (changes workflow a bit, but simplifies many things)
- click for CLI (docopt is ok too, but gives a tonof depreciation warnings)

Enhancements/new features:

- streamlit app
- output dir for run command
